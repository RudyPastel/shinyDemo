# To do


A list of improvements worth considering.

## Necessary

* ~~Create a function to validate the income data set and test it~~
* Write a simple shiny module test
* More detailed tests


## Optional

* Create a second set of plot functions using plotly
* Create functions extracting subsets from the income data set

## On a whim

* Create place holding a page in the dash board describing the raw data set
* Create place holding a page in the dash board commenting the plots
